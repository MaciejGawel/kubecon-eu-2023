## ðŸŒ„ About This Repository

This repository holds the supplementary materials for my talk at KubeCon.

- Demo Steps and Details
- References

### About Demo

The demo during the talk was fully based on the input in this repository. You should be able to replicate the same setup following the steps detailed in this repository.

Also, before this talk goes available on YouTube, I will be also working to create some more example setup for using other tools.

### About Demo Script

During the presentation, I cheated ðŸ«£ a little by using a script to mock the typing effect. This is backed by a simple shell script https://github.com/rytswd/cli-demo-helper.
